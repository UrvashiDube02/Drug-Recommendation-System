# Drug-Recommendation-System

**PROBLEM DEFINITION:**
<br>
Pharmaquick is a pharmaceutical company/hospital that has approached us with a
problem statement that asks us to forecast which drug type is best for each
patient based on the information provided.
Our goal is to create a machine learning model that can accurately perform
this task while also providing insights into the data and advice on how to use
the model's output.
